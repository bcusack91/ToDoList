# ToDoList
Creating a Dynamic ToDo list using HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT

#Ball With Gravity

Title of the project: ToDo List - In this application, I've followed along with Dr. Sanchez's work to create a Todo list with elements that have been refactored to create more usable and readable code.  This is my first formal project utilizing React.

How to run: Be sure to have react set up on your device. To run, generate a local host in the terminal using the command "npx http-server".  It's recommended that you use an incognito tab in google if you are going to make any chances to avoid caching issues that may arise otherwise.
